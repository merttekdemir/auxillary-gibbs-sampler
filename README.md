In this repo performance diagnostics of two different Bayesian procedures for simulating the posterior distribution of a set of coefficients in a probit regression model  are compared. The simulation methods compared are the Metropolis algorithm and the auxiliary Gibbs algorithm. These procedures are compared using both a simulated dataset and a real dataset and for each dataset through different choices of priors, initializations of the coefficients and parameters for the proposal distributions.
